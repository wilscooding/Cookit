## Intended Market

Our intended market are people who love to cook, both just making up their own recipes and finding recipes online to adjust to their tastes. This is also ideal for those with busy lives who often find themselves at the grocery store and can't remember if they have an ingredient already or not or everything that a recipe calls for. It's right in their pocket!

## Functionality

- Visitors to the site will be prompted to make an account.
    - Because so much of this app is centered around an individulized experience, an account is required.
- Once logged in, a visitor can search a 3rd party api database that houses thousands of recipes.
    - They can search by ingredient or diet prefernece (such as gluten free or dairy free)
    - If they find a recipe they like, they can save the recipe to their own recipe book, allowing them to edit to their own tastes.
- A user can add their own recipes.
    - Their recipe book is displayed in cards with an image, title, and description.
- A user can add/edit/delete ingredients to their inventory.
    - There is notes section for any additional notes, such as experation date or if it's frozen/needs to thaw.
- A user can add/delete items from their grocery list.
    - There is a notes section for any additional notes, such as aisle, brand preference, or variety choice.
