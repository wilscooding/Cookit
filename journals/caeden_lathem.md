May 15th- Nolan driving. Add SQL database, created table for user and recipes.

May 16th- Nolan driving. FastAPI integration for recipes, ingredients, measurements linked to users. I updtaed the docker-compose.yaml to change baseUrl for authentification.

May 17th- Me driving. Worked on login/logout function with auth.

May18th-26th- Was having trouble getting a token back for login/register. We were using email to log in/register when the library we were using expected 'username'. In addition, we were struggling to get baseUrl to pass in like it was supposed to. Took several days to work through this one.

May 30th- With auth working, I added a logout button to the nav bar.

May 31st- Updated nav bar so logout only show ups when logged in and sign up/login only shows if not logged in.
