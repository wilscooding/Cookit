Before the 15th we were all working on our wire frames. Nolan worked on the backend wireframe and me and wilkin worked on frontend wireframe. Caeden worked on our loading icon. We all chose a color theme as a unit and were messing around with different logos we could have.
5/15: Sql database day Wilkin/Nolan drove and we helped them build out the tables and models
5/16: fastapi integration and we all were working with nolan as he was driving and Nolan suggested we make this app into an iphone app so Caeden and I were watching react native videos to try to be ready for frontend.
5/17: worked on login/logout and fixed auth issue - I believe Caeden did logout and Nolan worked on login and then I was there to help with fixing auth and making sure it was working
5/18-5/26th: I drove at least three times during this period and we were having issues with the token and auth. Wilkin and Nolan worked on most of the auth and I helped fix errors and get it to work
